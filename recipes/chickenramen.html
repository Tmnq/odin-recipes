                <li>¾ cup thinly sliced carrot</li>

                <li>1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil</li>

                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 cups cubed cooked chicken</li>
                <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles with seasoning packet</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon lime zest, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Honey Sriracha Crackers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons Sriracha sauce</li>
                <li>9 ounces oyster crackers</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <h3>Soup:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add carrot, celery, and onion. Cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and garlic. Cook 1 minute more. Add broth, soy sauce, basil, oregano, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until carrots are just tender about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li> Stir in cooked chicken and ramen noodles. Simmer, uncovered, until noodles are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in lime juice. Ladle soup into bowls. Sprinkle with lime zest and, if you like, additional basil and oregano leaves, and serve with Honey-Sriracha Crackers.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3> Honey-Sriracha Crackers:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch baking pan with foil. </li>
                <li> Heat canola oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in honey, Sriracha, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the reserved ramen seasoning packet. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in oyster crackers. Toss together until evenly coated. </li>
                <li> Transfer crackers to the prepared pan and spread to an even layer. </li>
                <li> Bake in the preheated oven, stirring once, until light golden and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely (crackers will continue to crisp as they cool). Store crackers in an airtight container at room temperature up to 2 weeks. </li>
            </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
        <p>You can use lemon juice and zest instead of lime for the soup.</p>
